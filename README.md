# Test

Welcome to Kreitech technical test!
The idea for this test is to see a little bit of how you code, making a simple exercise which
shouldn’t take more than 3 hours of your time. You will be using React JS and the Spotify API.
The exercise consists of creating a small app to search Spotify tracks using its API and display
the results. Feel free to use any layout you consider suitable for this exercise, though, we
believe a grid would be the easiest one.
We encourage you to follow the best coding practices you know.
Use create-react-app to start the project. The only npm package you are enabled to install is
axios (but you can use all the additional functionalities which are included in create-react-app).
Do the Spotify API authentication as simple as possible, don’t worry if you use external tools to
get a token.
Don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any doubts about the exercise.
Your solution should work on the latest version of Google Chrome.

# Solution
1. npm install
2. bg serve -o
